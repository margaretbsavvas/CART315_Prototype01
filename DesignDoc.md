Prototype 1 for CART315 course taken in winter 2023 

Design Doc 

Hypothesis: 
   Using only visuals, will a player know where to look for a fish and know the exact location of the fish?
 
Notes from playtest:
  -Everybody guessed W, A, S, D to move and SHIFT to sprint 
  -Players were unsure of where to go or what the main goal/task was
  -Because I had to quickly remake my prototype before the class, the fish were cubes. Players didn't know that the cubes 
    fish and did not guess that they were fish. Players just thought there was cubes with particles to indicate that there
    was some sort of interaction with the cube. 
  -All players wanted to pick up the cube
  -No water shader on the lake, so players were unsure of when they were actual under water. 1 player even avoided the water 
    at first because they thought that they would drown and die. 
  -Everyone understood that the particles indicated/pointed out something
  -Walking speed was very slow. With SPRINT it was like normal walking speed (bug)
  -Many comments on the scenery of the mountains. Said it was relaxing to just explore and that the slow walking bug kind of 
    worked to make it calmer. 
  -Due to slow walking speed, 1 player said they thought it was a turtle simulator because of the environment 
  -Mountains act a a visual frontier to tell the player there is nothing beyond
  -A few players felt the need to reach the top of the tallest mountain
  -1 player suggested to add animation to fish. have them move away from the player when approached/near 
  -Another player suggested adding soundsto ehance the visuals 
  
Reflection:
   I would say that my hypothesis and prototype was a failure because nobody even though that the cubes could be fish or any sort 
   of animal. 
   I learned that if I wanted to properly visually communicate something, then the entire prototype should have been much more 
   detailed. For example, I shoud have downloaded free fish assets to replace the cubes. Given the short time I had to remake a
   prototype due my original files being corrupted, I decided to leave the cubes as is. I thought that if they were underwater 
   than its obvious that they were fish because what else would have bubbles emerging out of the water? But I thought wrong. I
   also learned that everyone WANTED to interact with something. Although it was meant to be strictle explorative, having no goal 
   or interactions confused the player even further.
   If I continued working on this prototype, I would use actual fish assets. I would also have the player drown if they were to 
   enter the water. They would have to use a boat to go out onto the lake, and I would add fishing mechanics in order to catch the fish.
   I would also animate the fish to move towards the surface of the watera and back down to the bottom of the lake. This would make the particles dissapear, indicating that the fish is no 
   "catchable" and the player would have to wait until it's near the surface to play again.
